  INSTALL

    Install Clip is pretty easy:
    Copy its files inside the /modules folder.
    Optionally, create a writable folder as ztemp/ClipModels,
    Clip will try to create it automatically if it doesn't exists.

    Go to your Modules Admin Panel and click the install icon.
    Configure the path where you want to upload files and images.
    That's all! begin the creation of your publication types
    and manage your stuff ;-)

    TEMPLATES
      Template files based on the Smarty template engine, and generated by Clip,
      to be used on the main, list, display and edit screens of the pubtypes.
      They can be customized to have as many layouts as required.


  USAGE

    Explore the default Blog and Pages pubtypes to learn how they are defined.
    You can create your own pubtype, all the required details are in the form.
    After that, you can define the fields that will need the publications on it.
    Once defined, you can get the templates code generated by Clip,
    and put them in the recommended directory to start the customization.
    In those template you can apply all your HTML + CSS skills,
    and Clip will take care of the rest.

    You can build an entry screen to your pubtype, with the main.tpl.
    If you don't use it, Clip will redirect to the list view then.
    You can add any JavaScript library or utilities on your templates,
    to match your graphic design and the usability of your pubtype.


  CATEGORIES USAGE

    Clip offers some pubfields connected to the Zikula's Categories System.
    They are List, MultiCheckbox List, Multiple Selector and Radio List,
    and uses a specific category as the root of their lists selectors.

    You can configure them to select which root category to use from all your
    registered trees for Clip's "clip_pubtypes" table in the Category Registry
    (/index.php?module=Categories&type=admin&func=editregistry).

    Those fields can be filtered on the publication lists, and the Pages
    default pubtype has an example on its main.tpl on how to use the clip_category_browser.
